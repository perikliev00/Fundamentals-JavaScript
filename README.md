Welcome to my JavaScript Fundamentals repository! 🚀
This repository contains a series of exercises designed to strengthen my understanding of essential programming concepts and algorithms. Through these exercises, I've learned how to solve problems using fundamental JavaScript techniques such as arrays, loops, string manipulation, objects, and various data structures.
Key Skills & Concepts Learned 🧠
1. Arrays & Array Manipulation 🧩

    Traversing and modifying arrays using loops and array methods like .push(), .map(), .filter(), and .reduce().
    Implementing sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort) to organize data.
    Performing search and transformation operations on arrays.

2. Loops & Iteration 🔄

    Using for loops, while loops, and forEach to iterate over arrays and objects.
    Solving problems that involve iterating through data and applying logic on each item.

3. String Manipulation 🔤

    Reversing strings and checking for palindromes.
    Using methods like .split(), .slice(), .substring(), and .replace() to manipulate and transform strings.
    Counting character frequencies and handling unwanted characters in strings.

4. Objects & Object Manipulation 🏷️

    Working with objects and modifying their properties.
    Implementing nested objects and accessing/modifying their values.
    Comparing objects and performing logical operations on object data.

5. Data Structures 🏗️

    Implementing basic data structures such as Stacks, Queues, and Linked Lists.
    Using Maps and Sets to efficiently store and manage key-value pairs and unique values.
